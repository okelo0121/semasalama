> **"Safety is not a slogan. It’s something we build — together — with courage and code."**

**Sema Salama** is a browser-based digital shield designed to protect African women in public life from Online Gender-Based Violence (OGBV). Unlike standard moderation tools, Sema Salama uses a hyper-local lexicon to detect and blur context-specific hate speech in **Swahili, Sheng, and Pidgin**—language nuances that Silicon Valley algorithms often miss.

---

## 🚨 The Problem
African female leaders, journalists, and activists face severe online harassment. Global platforms rely on AI that is trained primarily on Western English datasets.
* **The Gap:** Algorithms fail to flag localized slurs (e.g., specific derogatory terms in Sheng or tribal dialects).
* **The Impact:** Women are silenced, traumatized, or forced to leave digital public squares.

## 💡 The Solution
**Sema Salama** is a client-side browser extension that acts as a personal "Digital Bodyguard."
* **Real-time Sanitization:** Scans your social media feed (X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) as you scroll.
* **Context-Aware:** Detects hyper-local insults and threats using a community-sourced African lexicon.
* **Agency:** Blurs the violence visually but gives the user the power to "click to reveal" if they need to collect evidence.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🛡️ The Local Shield:** Uses `MutationObserver` to instantly detect and blur hate speech in the DOM before it triggers a psychological response.
* **👁️ Peep Mode:** Hover/Click functionality allows users to inspect blocked content safely for legal evidence gathering.
* **🌍 Multi-Platform Support:** Works seamlessly on **X (Twitter)**, **Facebook**, and **Instagram** using stable accessibility selectors.
* **🔒 Privacy-First Architecture:** All processing happens **locally on the device**. No browsing data is ever sent to a cloud server.
* **📝 Custom Blocklist:** Users can add their own specific trigger words to a personalized local blocklist.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering

This project was built using a "Safety by Design" methodology:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Core Logic:** `MutationObserver` API (for handling infinite scroll frameworks like React/Twitter).
* **Manifest:** Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
* **Data Structure:** JSON-based local lexicon optimized for O(1) lookup speeds.
* **Cross-Browser:** Compatible with Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

### How it Works (Under the Hood)
1.  **Injection:** The `content.js` script injects into the active tab matching social media URLs.
2.  **Observation:** The script sets up a `MutationObserver` to watch the DOM `body` for added nodes (new tweets/comments).
3.  **Filtration:** It extracts text from specific accessibility nodes (e.g., `[data-testid="tweetText"]`).
4.  **Sanitization:** Text is compared against `lexicon.json`. If a match is found, a CSS filter `blur(6px)` is applied to the parent node.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (The Big Project)

We are evolving Sema Salama from a browser extension to a full Digital Safety Ecosystem.

* **Phase 1 (Current):** Browser Extension for Desktop protection.
* **Phase 2 (In Progress):** **Android Accessibility App**. Using Android's `AccessibilityService` API to provide system-wide protection on mobile (WhatsApp, SMS, Twitter App).
* **Phase 3:** **Python API & Cloud Intelligence**. Moving the lexicon to a REST API (FastAPI) to allow for real-time updates of new hate speech trends without app updates.
